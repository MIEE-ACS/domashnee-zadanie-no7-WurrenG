I have added a "Bonus" class describing the behaviour of a bonus object on the game field.

The launch of the game by clicking on the button in the main application window was replañed by
launching via any key on a keyboard.To implement this functionality I have removed the method
in MainWindow class that handled clicking on the start button. I replaced it with the
startGame method.

I have modified the Window_KeyDown method in MainWindow class to call the startGame
method whenever moveTimer is disabled. I have also modified the UpdateField and
moveTimer_Tick methods in MainWindow class to draw a bonus object and provide interaction
with it.

In the visual interface I removed the start button, maked the background transparent
and changed color of the foreground of the displayed titles.
